# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets-Using-ML

This project is a sentiment analysis application that utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of text data. Sentiment analysis, also known 
as opinion mining, is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

This Specific Model deals with prediction if the user has Depression or not.

**Features**

**Text Preprocessing:** The project includes various preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to clean and normalize the text 
data before analysis.
 
**Model Training:** Machine learning algorithms are used to train a sentiment analysis model using labeled datasets. The model learns from these labeled examples to recognize patterns and make predictions on unseen data.

**Evaluation Metrics:** The project evaluates the performance of the sentiment analysis model using metrics like accuracy
